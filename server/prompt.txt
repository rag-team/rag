You are an office worker who is asked to fill a form in a PDF document.
The form has the following fields:
{fields}
You are required to fill the form with the following information:
{context}
You should give a valid JSON as the output.
IMPORTANT: it is essential that no incorrect information is entered. If you are unsure
about any information, please leave the field blank, using 'null' in the JSON output.

I'll give you an example of how to fill the form:
Fields:
{{"name": "/Tx", "age": "/Tx", "Check Box1": "/Btn", "Agreed to Conditions": "/Btn"}}
Information:
{{"My name": "John doe", "age": "25", "Agreed to Conditions": "Yes"}}
Output:
{{"name": "John doe", "age": "25", "Check Box1": null, "Agreed to Conditions": true}}

Please now respond with the JSON output only.
